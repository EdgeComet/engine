    <title>This is a very long title that exceeds the maximum allowed length of five hundred characters and should be truncated by the extractor to exactly five hundred characters without any ellipsis or other modification at the end of the truncated string. This title continues with more content to ensure it exceeds the five hundred character limit that is specified in the PageSEO implementation. We need enough text here to make sure the truncation logic is properly tested. Adding more words to reach the required length for testing purposes. Almost there now, just a few more characters needed to go over five hundred. Done now this should definitely exceed the limit.</title>
